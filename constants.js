  "In this visualization, we take a look at several points of interest on the S&P 500 where there was a decline in the price and the possible reasons for the changes. The 2015-2016 selloff was a period of time in which the stock market experienced two major declines in value, but was able to recover relatively quickly. The first decline seems to be related to the stock market popping in China which caused declines globally, the price reached an inflection point in September and was able to recover fully in November. However, the federal reserve and other oil prices dropping seemed to have caused the second decline in value, which was able to recover in March of 2016.";

  "The S&P 500 dropped in late 2018 due to a combination of factors. One of the major factors was the Trump administration's tariffs on imported aluminum, steel, and other goods, which introduced a large amount of uncertainty into the global economy. Additionally, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates four times in 2018, leading to concerns that the central bank was raising rates too quickly. Concerns over subdued earnings and regulatory fears led to a sell-off of large tech companies. There were also concerns that company earnings were inflated, which may have contributed to the decline in the stock market. The GOP tax cuts may have also played a role in the decline of the stock market. Despite signs that the general economy was still doing well, with record low unemployment, strong GDP growth, and relatively low inflation, other factors outweighed these positive economic indicators.";

  "The 2020 crash occurred because investors were worried about the impact of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic. The uncertainty over the danger of the virus, plus the shuttering of many businesses and industries as states implemented shutdown orders, damaged many sectors of the economy. The drop was caused by unbridled global fears about the spread of the coronavirus, oil price drops, and the possibility of a 2020 recession. Although the 2020 market crash was dramatic, it didn't last. The stock market experienced a surprising recovery, even as many areas of the U.S. economy continued to experience trouble.";

The index is still down nearly 14% from its peak in January 2022 and has been in and out of bear market territory over the past year. Despite this, the S&P 500 has had an impressive performance over the past decade, with an average annual return of 13.6%. This is due in part to the strong performance of the US economy, as well as the actions of the Federal Reserve to support the markets.";
